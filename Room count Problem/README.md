Assumptions
1. Timings of workshop may overlap i.e 2 or more workshops may be held at the same time
2. Assume that all workshops are conducted by a different person and attended by different people.
3. There is no time taken to vacate/clean the rooms, therefore, workshop can start as soon as the previous one ends
4. All workshops must be conducted on the same day
